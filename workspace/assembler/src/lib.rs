//! #assembler
//!
//! This is a new code base to efficiently assemble 64-bit x86 (AMD64 long mode) machine code at runtime.
//!
//! Instructions are emitted by using the mnemonic-like methods on the `InstructionStream` trait.
//! These are designed to work with Rust's Release optimizations to compile down to just a sequence of byte stores to memory.
//!
//! In addition, labels are supported which are then calculated using a second-pass.
